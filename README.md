# OpenSSL_jll.jl

This is an autogenerated package constructed using [`BinaryBuilder.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaPackaging/BinaryBuilder.jl).

## Usage

The code bindings within this package are autogenerated from the `Products` defined within the `build_tarballs.jl` file that generated this package.  For example purposes, we will assume that the following products were defined:

```julia
products = [
    FileProduct("src/data.txt", :data_txt),
    LibraryProduct("libdataproc", :libdataproc),
    ExecutableProduct("mungify", :mungify_exe)
]
```

With such products defined, this package will contain `data_txt`, `libdataproc` and `mungify_exe` symbols exported. For `FileProduct` variables, the exported value is a string pointing to the location of the file on-disk.  For `LibraryProduct` variables, it is a string corresponding to the `SONAME` of the desired library (it will have already been `dlopen()`'ed, so typical `ccall()` usage applies), and for `ExecutableProduct` variables, the exported value is a function that can be called to set appropriate environment variables.  Example:

```julia
using OpenSSL_jll

# For file products, you can access its file location directly:
data_lines = open(data_txt, "r") do io
    readlines(io)
end

# For library products, you can use the exported variable name in `ccall()` invocations directly
num_chars = ccall((libdataproc, :count_characters), Cint, (Cstring, Cint), data_lines[1], length(data_lines[1]))

# For executable products, you can use the exported variable name as a function that you can call
mungify_exe() do mungify_exe_path
    run(`$mungify_exe_path $num_chars`)
end
```
